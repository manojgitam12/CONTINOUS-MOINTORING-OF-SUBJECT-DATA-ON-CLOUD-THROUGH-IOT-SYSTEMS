# CONTINOUS-MOINTORING-OF-SUBJECT-DATA-ON-CLOUD-THROUGH-IOT-SYSTEMS
This project implements an IoT-based system for real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, and motion data. IoT sensors collect and transmit data to a secure cloud platform via MQTT/HTTP, where it is processed and visualized through an intuitive dashboard. Machine learning enhances anomaly detection and predictive analytics.
